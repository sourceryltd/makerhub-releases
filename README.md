Makerverse and Makerhub prior to v1.3.0  are now officially unsupported. There are sometimes ways to patch old versions of makerverse and makerhub (they all had various bugs that have been addressed and fixed) but occassionally those solutions still don't work in some edge cases.

If there are any feature requests, bugs, annoyances, etc,  please open a ticket. 

Recent Fixes:

- version 1.3.0  had two errors in the default machine profile coordinates.  Those are fixed in version 1.3.1-beta1
- forgot to build an appImage for version 1.3.0,  there's no  1.3.0 appImage but there is for  1.3.1
