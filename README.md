Starting with MakerHub v1.2.1, if you were previously using MakerHub v1.2.0 or any version of Makerverse you will need to delete the following files and uninstall previous versions of Makerverse or MakerHub:

For Windows Users:

delete:

C:\Users\{your windows user name}\.makerverse
C:\Users\{your windows user name}\.makerverse-sessions

For MacOS Users:

delete

/Users/{your user name}/.makerverse
/Users/{your user name}/.makerverse-sessions

A partner webservice  OWS (Open Work Shop) went offline and will not be returning in the forseeable future. MakerHub v1.2.1 fixes this problem but you will unfortunately need to recreate your machine profiles and recalibrate the machine.
